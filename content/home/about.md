# Biography

I completed my BSc in Biology and MSc in Cell Biology by the University of Valencia. After participating in Synthetic Biology’s iGEM competition I discovered the use of models in Biology, which pushed me to pursue a PhD in the Department of Applied Mathematics in the Technical University of Valencia. 

My research on Metabolic Engineering of hydrogen in cyanobacteria led to be a visiting researcher at Uppsala University, Denmark Technical University and EMBL Heidelberg. After graduating, I decided to apply modelling techniques to Cancer and moved to Institut Curie's Systems Biology department where I works as a postdoctoral fellow in logical models and data deconvolution and integration.
