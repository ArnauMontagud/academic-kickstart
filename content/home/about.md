# Biography

Arnau Montagud completed his BSc in Biology and MSc in Cell Biology by the University of Valencia. After participating in Synthetic Biologyâ€™s iGEM competition he discovered the use of models in Biology, which pushed him to pursue a PhD in the Department of Applied Mathematics in the Technical University of Valencia. 

His research on Metabolic Engineering of hydrogen in cyanobacteria led him to be a visiting researcher at Uppsala University, Denmark Technical University and EMBL Heidelberg. After graduating, he decided to apply modelling techniques to Cancer and moved to Institut Curie's Systems Biology department where he works as a postdoctoral fellow in data deconvolution and logical models.
