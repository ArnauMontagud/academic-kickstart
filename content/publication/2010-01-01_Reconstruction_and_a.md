abstract = "Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 is a cyanobacterium considered as a candidate photo-biological production platformâ€“an attractive cell factory capable of using CO2 and light as carbon and energy source, respectively. In order to enable efficient use of metabolic potential of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, it is of importance to develop tools for uncovering stoichiometric and regulatory principles in the Synechocystis metabolic network."
